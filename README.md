# Inventory Manager
The Inventory Manager allows users to keep track of their school's VEX Robotics Competition teams inventories. The website enables students to easily know if the parts they need are avaiable in the school's shared inventory and log if they take anything. Coaches have access to add parts to the digital inventory if new pieces are purchased. Furthermore, the ability to add custom items to the website enables any organization to use this website, expanding the scope past just VEX Robotics teams.
